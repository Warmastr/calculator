# Calculator

## Overview
This is a standard calculator application with a few extras thrown in for my own experience in developing. The calculator should perform standard calculations in arithmetic such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Additionally, this calculator will be able to handle decimal numbers, as well as fractions. 

### Features
* Multi-function calculator for basic arithmetic
* Fraction calculator

## Background
This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) and wraps up the Foundations portion of the curriculum. Upon successful completion of the calculator project, Foundations is then finalized by selecting the latter half of the program. 

## Tools
This program will utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a calculator application that will be completely functional and will be able to be deployed to any web site as a standalone application or a web application.

The calculator project was created by Jeffery Argyle and is open source. You are free to use this as you see fit so long as you do not sell or profit from the code.
